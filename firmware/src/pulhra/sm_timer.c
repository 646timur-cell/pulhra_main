/* TIMER5 outranks ALNK0, so the scan keeps its 100 us pace while a half buffer renders: before,
 * the ticks stopped for the whole render (0.7 ms idle, several ms loaded), the column lit when it
 * began stayed lit that long (a ~16 Hz flicker over all LEDs, beating with the scan) and the
 * encoders lost frames. Nested in ALNK0 it only scans (GPIO + fm1_in, nothing the audio ISR touches)
 * and counts ms; USB and UART polls wait for the first tick after the render, as they always did,
 * and the time spent nested is handed to the audio ISR so its load figures stay render-only.
 * The USB audio stream cannot wait for the render (one packet per 1 ms frame, a render takes up to
 * ~5 ms): uac_service also runs nested. It touches only EP4 (INDEX is set on every access) and the
 * consumer side of the audio ring, and usb_poll never runs nested, so the two never interleave. */
